# TauSwap Protocol Specification v0.1

This is a reference to the full TauSwap Protocol Specification. The complete specification document should be placed here.

For now, see the original specification provided in the project requirements.

## Key Points

- **Operation Groups**: Uses `operations["2"]` for intents and `operations["3"]` for settlements
- **Batch Clearing**: All intents in a block are cleared together
- **CPMM**: Constant Product Market Maker with deterministic rounding
- **Formal Verification**: Tau Language specifications enforce invariants
- **Agent Support**: Intent-based interface for autonomous agents

## Implementation Status

✅ Core CPMM algorithm
✅ Batch clearing algorithm
✅ Liquidity management
✅ Intent system
✅ Settlement validation
✅ Tau Language specifications (draft)
✅ Integration layer (placeholder)
✅ Test suite

## Next Steps

- Integration with Tau Testnet Alpha (when available)
- Full Tau Language validation implementation
- Performance optimization
- Agent SDK development
