# Settlement Algebra + Batch CPMM (Paper Draft)

This folder contains a compiled paper PDF describing the mathematical model and
mechanized Lean proofs in:

- `lean-mathlib/Proofs/SettlementAlgebra.lean`
- `lean-mathlib/Proofs/BatchOptimality.lean`
- `lean-mathlib/Proofs/CPMMInvariants.lean`
- `lean-mathlib/Proofs/CPMMSettlement.lean`
- `lean-mathlib/Proofs/BatchCPMMUnification.lean`

## Notes

- The repository intentionally tracks the compiled artifact `settlement-algebra-batch-cpmm.pdf`.
- The LaTeX sources are not tracked.
